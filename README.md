# aurora_project

This is a test project which consists of the items manager and the database that stores items and users.

On the main page you can see a list of items from the database, navigation panel and a form to log in. 

Unauthorized visitors can only view the items, add a new user or log in.

Authorized users can also add new items, edit and delete existing items.

You can use either "aurora"/"creation2022" login/password to authorize or create your own user.

config.php contains credentials to the database.
